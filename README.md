## About Project

This project was created to implement the following :-

1) ChakraUI - Used ChakraUI Components for a better UI
2) React Hooks - Hooks were used instead of lifecycle components 
3) React Router - For Routing, used the react-router-dom library 
4) React Redux - To make changes in the main data, used redux with react using react-redux library
5) Decomposed React Components - Earlier version of this dashboard was implemented in a single file. With this implementation, decomposed it into smaller subcomponents.
